# Justification Research

A construction site is like a living being. Evrything is moving on its own for a greater task. This means when one part of the site is delayed because the tools needed were lost or forgotten at the base, thew whole project gets messed up, and its costing billions. This means extra pressure is placed on workers to find their materials quickly. This causes them to sometimes skip out on saftey percausion while searching, with construction sites being one of the most dangerous places to be. With increasing worries, our drone would solve these problems, safely delivering tools, and not having to worry about unsafe paths.
